Near Term
=========

* Add support for rrdtool info
  - DONE - this is going to be something like an object-RRD-mapper...
  - DONE - if we can get all the information about an RRD (including DSs and
    RRAs) we would be able to rebuild full objects representing actual RRD
    files (we'd nee to add a "read" method to the RRD class)
  - DONE - in order to pull in as much details as possible, it might be more useful to
    use "rrdtool dump" and parse the XML
  - DONE - with that in place, calling info() would essentially just be a method that
    displays data stored in the RRD object itself
  - even if we don't support something that pretends to be an atomic operation,
    we should still check state before an overwrite... maybe something like
    this:
    . create tempfile and update to it
    . save it
    . get its checksum
    . get the checksum of the original
    . if they are different, raise an inconsistent state exception
    . also provide a means of forcing an overwrite... 'cause sometimes people
      just like to smack shit around
    . if no exception is raised, move the tempfile over the original (there's
      still a race condition there)
  - DONE - I haven't decided on how to handle the .load() in general... whether
    to do it automatically or to leave it as an explicit step for the user.
    Hrm. I could take a hint from Python's open() and pass "r" or "w"
    parameters, and have the behaviour adjusted accordingly...

* Write up a good README, taking examples from the wiki/docstrings so that it
  will look good (and be informative) on PyPI, and then upload to PyPI

* Add a wrapper for the Python RRDTool bindings
  - since the doctests are mostly to show API functionality, we'll need to add
    unit tests for both backends (cli wrapper and bindings wrapper)
  - the python bindings should be fairly straight-forward to support, since we
    should just be able to split on the parameters that are currently
    calculated

* Add docstrings for the classes in the new xml module.
  - add *all* missing docstrings

* Allow for users to supply their own fd to pyrrd.graph

* Allow for users to decide which backend will be used on an
  instance-by-instance basis

* Update all examples for recent dates like example4 has been updated

* Stop using actual file writes for doctests and use StringIO instead

Future
======

* Add an RPN class.

* Add a DS collection class that has a get() method for getting a
  particular DS by name.

* - DONE - Finish support for fetch().
  - DONE - check fetch data from rrdtool.fetch (python bindings)
    . ugh - checked and not a fan
    . no driving need to maintain compatibility with it (yet)
  - put fetch results into a mapper class (this will have to wait until the
    mapper classes are supporting XML dump database reads)
  - allow printing of results (add info method to other rrd.* classes)
  - DONE - put sub-node data into getData method(s)

* Add support for atomic operations.
