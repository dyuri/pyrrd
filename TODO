Near Term
=========

* Add support for rrdtool info

* Write up a good README, taking examples from the wiki/docstrings so that it
  will look good (and be informative) on PyPI, and then upload to PyPI

* Add a wrapper for the Python RRDTool bindings
  - since the doctests are mostly to show API functionality, we'll need to add
    unit tests for both backends (cli wrapper and bindings wrapper)
  - the python bindings should be fairly straight-forward to support, since we
    should just be able to split on the parameters that are currently
    calculated

* Allow for users to supply their own fd to pyrrd.graph

* Allow for users to decide which backend will be used on an
  instance-by-instance basis


Future
======

* Add an RPN class.

* Add a DS collection class that has a get() method for getting a
  particular DS by name.

* Finish support for fetch().
