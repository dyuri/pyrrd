Near Term
=========

* Add support for rrdtool info
  - this is going to be something like an object-RRD-mapper...
  - will return an object
  - the object should repr like the cli output
  - if we were to go by the printout from "rrdtool info", we'd have an
    attribute mapping something like the following:
    . filename
    . rrd_version
    . step
    . last_update
    . dss (ds list)
    . rras (rra list)
  - each element of the ds list would have the following attributes
    . type
    . min
    . max
    . last_ds
    . value
    . unknown_sec
  - each element of the rra list would have the following attributes
    . cf
    . pdp_per_row
    . cdp_preps (cdp_rep list)
  - each element of the cdp_prep would have the following attributes
    . value
    . unknown_datapoints
  - we already have the following objects:
    . RRD
    . DataSource/DS
    . RRA
  - as such, if we can get all the information about an RRD (including DSs and
    RRAs) we would be able to rebuild full objects representing actual RRD
    files (we'd nee to add a "read" method to the RRD class)
  - in order to pull in as much details as possible, it might be more useful to
    use "rrdtool dump" and parse the XML
  - with that in place, calling info() would essentially just be a method that
    displays data stored in the RRD object itself
  - even if we don't support something that pretends to be an atomic operation,
    we should still check state before an overwrite... maybe something like
    this:
    . create tempfile and update to it
    . save it
    . get its checksum
    . get the checksum of the original
    . if they are different, raise an inconsistent state exception
    . also provide a means of forcing an overwrite... 'cause sometimes people
      just like to smack shit around
    . if no exception is raised, move the tempfile over the original (there's
      still a race condition there)

* Write up a good README, taking examples from the wiki/docstrings so that it
  will look good (and be informative) on PyPI, and then upload to PyPI

* Add a wrapper for the Python RRDTool bindings
  - since the doctests are mostly to show API functionality, we'll need to add
    unit tests for both backends (cli wrapper and bindings wrapper)
  - the python bindings should be fairly straight-forward to support, since we
    should just be able to split on the parameters that are currently
    calculated

* Add docstrings for the classes in the new xml module.

* Allow for users to supply their own fd to pyrrd.graph

* Allow for users to decide which backend will be used on an
  instance-by-instance basis


Future
======

* Add an RPN class.

* Add a DS collection class that has a get() method for getting a
  particular DS by name.

* Finish support for fetch().

* Add support for atomic operations.
