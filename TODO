Near Term
---------

* Move test code around (testing and admin/testRunner).

* Fix breaking tests.

* Add wiki examples for using info and fetch

* Improve the wrapper for the Python RRDTool bindings

  * a lot of the code in PyRRD was written quite a while ago (circa 2004), and
    needs to be refactored (removing redundancies, use better idioms, etc.)

* Allow for users to supply their own fd to pyrrd.graph.

* Update all examples for recent dates like example4 has been updated.

* Stop using actual file writes and doctests for file tests; use unit tests
  (and StringIO) instead.

Future
------

* Add an RPN class.

* Add a DS collection class that has a get() method for getting a
  particular DS by name.

* Add support for atomic operations.
