Near Term
---------

* Add wiki examples for using info and fetch

* Add a wrapper for the Python RRDTool bindings

  - Since the doctests are mostly to show API functionality, we'll need to add
    unit tests for both backends (cli wrapper and bindings wrapper).

  - The python bindings should be fairly straight-forward to support, since we
    should just be able to split on the parameters that are currently
    calculated.

* Allow for users to supply their own fd to pyrrd.graph.

* Allow for users to decide which backend will be used on an
  instance-by-instance basis.

* Update all examples for recent dates like example4 has been updated.

* Stop using actual file writes and doctests for file tests; use unit tests
  (and StringIO) instead.

Future
------

* Add an RPN class.

* Add a DS collection class that has a get() method for getting a
  particular DS by name.

* Add support for atomic operations.
