= PyRRD Installation =

== Standard Python Install ==

If you have downloaded the tarball from http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/PyRRD/ and you have root privs, you can just do the regular:
{{{
$ sudo python setup.py install
}}}

== Setuptools Install ==

If you have {{{setuptools}}} installed and root privs, you can use {{{easy_install}}}, letting it find the latest release and downloading the file:
{{{
$ sudo easy_install PyRRD
}}}

If you want to upgrade, just add the {{{--upgrade}}} parameter:
{{{
$ sudo easy_install --upgrade PyRRD
}}}

== Local Install ==

If you don't have root privs, the easiest thing to do is to use the {{{.egg}}} file:
{{{
$ wget http://cheeseshop.python.org/packages/2.4/P/PyRRD/PyRRD-W.X.Y-py2.Z.egg
$ mv PyRRD-W.X.Y-py2.Z.egg ~/mypython/libs
$ export PYTHONPATH=~/mypython/libs
}}}

Note that the {{{export VARNAME}}} is {{{bash}}} syntax. See your shell documentation if you aren't using a {{{bash}}}-compatible shell.

You can now use PyRRD in the following manner:
{{{
$ python
>>> from pkg_resources import require
>>> require('PyRRD')
>>> from pyrrd.rrd import RRD, RRA, DS
>>> from pyrrd.graph import DEF, CDEF, VDEF
>>> from pyrrd.graph import LINE, AREA, GPRINT
>>> from pyrrd.graph import ColorAttributes, Graph
[etc]
}}}

Note that using {{{.egg}}} files requires that you have {{{setuptools}}} installed (either system-wide, or in your local python path).
